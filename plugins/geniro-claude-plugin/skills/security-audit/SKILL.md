Perform an OWASP Top 10 security audit on the following:

## What to Audit

$ARGUMENTS

## Context

The Geniro platform consists of two repositories:
- **geniro/** — NestJS API backend (TypeORM, Vitest, Zod DTOs, Keycloak auth)
- **geniro-web/** — React frontend (Vite, Ant Design, Refine, Socket.io)

## Your Task

1. **Identify what changed** — use `git diff`, `git status`, or read the specific files/areas mentioned.
2. **Audit every changed file** against the OWASP Top 10 checklist, adapted for this stack.
3. **Check cross-cutting concerns** — auth decorators on new endpoints, input validation on new DTOs, XSS vectors in new React components.
4. **Run dependency audit** if package.json changed: `cd geniro && pnpm audit --json 2>/dev/null || true` or `cd geniro-web && pnpm audit --json 2>/dev/null || true`.
5. **Produce a Security Audit Report** with the standard format: risk level, findings with severity/location/fix, and summary.

Focus on real, exploitable issues. Don't flag theoretical concerns that the framework already mitigates.
