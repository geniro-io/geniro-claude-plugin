Validate the following architect specification against the actual Geniro codebase.

## What to Validate

$ARGUMENTS

## Context

The Geniro platform consists of two repositories:
- **geniro/** — NestJS API backend (TypeORM, Vitest, Zod DTOs)
- **geniro-web/** — React frontend (Vite, Ant Design, Refine, Socket.io)

## Your Task

1. **Extract every factual claim** from the specification — file paths, function names, class names, import paths, module references, package dependencies, and pattern references.
2. **Verify each claim** against the actual codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep. Batch verifications for efficiency.
3. **Produce a Skeptic Validation Report** with the standard format: verified claims, mirages found, warnings, and summary.

Be thorough but efficient. False negatives (missed mirages) are worse than false positives (flagging something that's actually fine).
