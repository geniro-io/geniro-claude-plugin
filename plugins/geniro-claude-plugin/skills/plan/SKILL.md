# Architecture Plan

Analyze the following task and produce an implementation-ready specification:

$ARGUMENTS

## Context

The Geniro platform consists of two repositories:
- **geniro/** — NestJS API backend (TypeORM, Vitest, Zod DTOs)
- **geniro-web/** — React frontend (Vite, Ant Design, Refine, Socket.io)

## Your Task

1. **Explore both codebases** — read project docs, find related code, understand existing patterns.
2. **Design the change** — choose the approach that fits current architecture with minimal, clean modifications.
3. **Produce a full specification** with:
   - Risk assessment (scope, breaking changes, confidence, rollback)
   - File-level scope (direct changes + ripple effects)
   - Step-by-step implementation plan with verification actions per step
   - Key test scenarios (happy path + edge/error cases)
   - List of explored files so engineers can skip redundant reads
4. **Separate API and Web work** clearly so it can be delegated to the right agents.

Be thorough but pragmatic. The goal is a spec that engineers can execute without follow-up questions.
