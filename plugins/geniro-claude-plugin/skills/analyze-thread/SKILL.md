# Analyze Thread

Analyze the following Geniro thread for quality issues, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities.

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Parse the input.** The first argument is the thread ID (UUID). Everything after it is optional user notes providing context about what to look for.

2. **If no thread ID was provided**, list the 10 most recent threads so the user can pick one:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, status, "createdAt",
     (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages m WHERE m."threadId" = t.id AND m."deletedAt" IS NULL) as message_count
   FROM threads t
   WHERE t."deletedAt" IS NULL
   ORDER BY t."createdAt" DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```
   Then STOP and ask the user which thread to analyze.

3. **If a thread ID was provided**, proceed with the full analysis workflow as defined in your agent prompt. Use the user notes (if any) to focus your investigation.

4. **Deliver the structured analysis report** with issues, token analysis, and actionable recommendations.

## Database Connection

```
Host: localhost
Port: 5439
User: postgres
Password: postgres
Database: geniro
```

Command: `PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -p 5439 -U postgres -d geniro -c "<SQL>"`

For queries returning large results, use:
`PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -p 5439 -U postgres -d geniro -t -A -F '|' -c "<SQL>"`

(`-t` = tuples only, `-A` = unaligned, `-F '|'` = pipe delimiter for readability)
